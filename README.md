# g-vault
g-Vault allows seamless secure access to any recognised system such as Postgres, mySQL, REDIS or any UNIX subsystem you may already
be leveraging within your infrastructure. In-addition, it seamlessly secures any sensitive data such as backups, files or documents.

There are commercial systems that say they do this, however g-Vault will deliver you an unparalleled level of security whilst being
easy to set-up, easy to slot into your existing system and is seamlessly integrated and self-contained. g-Vault is very simple and 
will improve your security in less than 60 seconds once installed as opposed to commercial systems which may take weeks to understand
and months to implement.

g-Vault starts from the premise that the bad actor has already:

  1/ Compromised your entire system with ‘root’ access.
  
  2/ Performed a block by block data dump of all connected drives to an off-site location for their off-line hack analysis.

Security must start here as this is the only thing you control. Security on the basis that your server is secured from unauthorised
external access is all well and good until the next undiscovered remote compromise BIND, sendmail, apache, netfilter or logging bug
when all of a sudden you can be. And let’s not forget insider trading, there’s good money to be made by simply running a command on
an internal server from one of many hacking groups.

You see, many companies don’t properly secure their servers due to legacy software and systems… modern day “security solutions” tend
to want to take over your entire security-verse and don’t work well in a standalone legacy environment. They are complicated, often
expensive to implement and in a bid to deliver your value for money, do a lot of stuff you don’t need!

g-Vault addresses these concerns albeit in a simple way, so if you care about your server security, then implement a g-Vault!
